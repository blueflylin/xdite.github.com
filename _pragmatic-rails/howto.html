      <h2><span class="caps">HOWTO</span></h2>
<p>This page goes over some of the guidelines that are used to determine who and what gets featured on the GitHub Rebase column. If you&#8217;re wondering how to get noticed, look no further! Also be aware that language diversity is encouraged throughout the column, so don&#8217;t be afraid if your project isn&#8217;t in Ruby or one of the other major languages in use.</p>
<p>Feel free to send <a href="http://github.com/qrush">qrush</a> a message if you would like to make sure that you&#8217;re considered. Going through the Inbox is a lot easier than searching through the <a href="http://github.com/languages">Languages</a> pages, so think of this as cutting the line, but no one will give you dirty looks.</p>
<h2>How to be the featured project</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Host your project here on GitHub (Obvious, but should be stated!)</li>
	<li>Somewhat mature codebase, it&#8217;s being used by others than the author. Out of alpha at least.</li>
	<li>Decent documentation, be it wikis, code docs, a GitHub page, or perhaps a separate project website</li>
	<li>Purpose of the project is clearly defined and easy to find</li>
	<li>Be something fun and useful to others!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to be a notably new project</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Project should have been created in the last week or two from when the column is written (usually on Sundays)</li>
	<li><span class="caps">README</span> is filled out, or some blog post/page is available to determine goals of the project</li>
	<li>Build something fun and useful to others!</li>
</ul>
